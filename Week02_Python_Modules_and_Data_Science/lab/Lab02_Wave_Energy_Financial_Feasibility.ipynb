    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Western Australian government is planning to add **100 MW** of new renewable energy capacity near Perth. As a consulting engineer, you've been asked to evaluate whether **wave energy** is a viable option compared to more established alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have access to a real dataset of wave energy converter (WEC) farm configurations near Perth from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/882/large-scale+wave+energy+farm). The dataset (`WEC_Perth_49.csv`) contains 36,000+ layout configurations for a farm of 49 wave energy converters, including individual and total power output for each configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to **compare wave energy against at least two other renewable energy technologies** in terms of financial feasibility for the Perth region."

    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook must include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Wave Energy Analysis (from the dataset)\n",
    "- Load and explore the `WEC_Perth_49.csv` dataset\n",
    "- Compute statistics on farm power output (mean, min, max, standard deviation)\n",
    "- Estimate a **capacity factor** for wave energy in Perth based on the data (you'll need to assume a rated capacity per WEC — research and justify your choice)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Competing Technologies\n",
    "- Choose **at least two** other renewable energy technologies to compare against wave energy (e.g., solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind, tidal, biomass)\n",
    "- Research and cite the following for **each** technology (including wave):\n",
    "  - Capital cost (CAPEX) per kW installed\n",
    "  - Annual operating cost (OPEX) per kW\n",
    "  - Capacity factor specific to the Perth region\n",
    "  - Expected project lifetime\n",
    "- **Cite your sources.** Use data from reputable organizations (e.g., IRENA, IEA, CSIRO, NREL, Lazard).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Financial Comparison\n",
    "- Calculate the **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)** for each technology\n",
    "- Calculate **at least one additional financial metric** of your choice (e.g., NPV, payback period, internal rate of return, cost per annual MWh)\n",
    "- Choose an appropriate **discount rate** and justify it\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visualization\n",
    "- Create **at least two plots** that clearly communicate your comparison\n",
    "- Plots should be publication-quality: labeled axes, title, legend, grid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Recommendation\n",
    "- Based on your analysis, write a short recommendation (1-2 paragraphs):\n",
    "  - Which technology (or mix) should Perth invest in?\n",
    "  - Under what conditions could wave energy become competitive?\n",
    "  - What factors does your financial model **not** capture?"
