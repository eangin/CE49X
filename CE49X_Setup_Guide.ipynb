    "## 1. Python & Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Python 3.10+** in this course. The easiest way to get a working scientific Python environment is through **Anaconda** — a free distribution that bundles Python with the libraries we need (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A: Anaconda (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a \"batteries included\" Python distribution designed for data science. It installs Python plus ~250 commonly used packages in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 — Download Anaconda:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 — Install:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| OS | Instructions |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Windows** | Run the `.exe` installer. Accept the defaults. When asked, check **\"Add Anaconda to my PATH\"** (makes it easier to use from the terminal). |\n",
    "| **macOS** | Run the `.pkg` installer. Accept the defaults. Anaconda will be installed to your home directory (`~/anaconda3` or `~/opt/anaconda3`). |\n",
    "| **Linux** | Run `bash Anaconda3-*-Linux-x86_64.sh` in a terminal. Accept the license and defaults. Say **yes** when asked to initialize Anaconda. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 — Verify the installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see something like `Python 3.11.x` or `Python 3.12.x`. Any version ≥ 3.10 is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: Miniconda (Lightweight Alternative)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer a minimal install and want to add packages yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download Miniconda from [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "2. Install it following the same steps as above\n",
    "3. Then install the required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: pip (If You Already Have Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have Python 3.10+ installed and prefer `pip`:\n",

    "An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a text editor with superpowers: syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, integrated terminals, and — increasingly — AI assistance built in.\n",

    "### Why Cursor?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Built on VS Code** | Same extensions ecosystem, keyboard shortcuts, and settings you may already know. |\n",
    "| **AI chat built in** | Ask questions about your code directly in the editor — no copy-pasting to a browser. |\n",
    "| **Tab completion with AI** | Intelligent code suggestions that understand context across your entire project. |\n",
    "| **Jupyter support** | Open and run `.ipynb` notebooks directly in the editor. |\n",
    "| **Free tier available** | The free plan includes AI features sufficient for coursework. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [https://cursor.com](https://cursor.com)\n",
    "2. Download the installer for your OS\n",
    "3. Install and launch Cursor\n",
    "4. If you have existing VS Code settings, Cursor will offer to import them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Cursor (or VS Code), install these extensions from the Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Extension | What It Does |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Python** (by Microsoft) | Python language support — IntelliSense, linting, debugging, formatting. Install this first. |\n",
    "| **Jupyter** (by Microsoft) | Run `.ipynb` notebooks directly in the editor. Essential for this course. |\n",
    "| **Pylance** (by Microsoft) | Fast, feature-rich Python language server. Provides type checking and better autocomplete. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting the Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the Python extension, you need to tell Cursor which Python installation to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette\n",
    "2. Type **\"Python: Select Interpreter\"** and press Enter\n",
    "3. Choose the Anaconda Python (it will say something like `Python 3.11.x ('base')` or `~/anaconda3/bin/python`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that when you run notebooks or scripts, the correct Python environment (with all your installed packages) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer plain VS Code without the built-in AI features:\n",
    "1. Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)\n",
    "2. Install the same extensions listed above\n",
    "3. Everything in this course will work identically — the AI features are optional, not required"

    "\n",
    "**Claude Code** is a command-line tool by Anthropic that brings Claude directly into your terminal. Unlike IDE-integrated tools, it can navigate your entire project, read and edit files, and run commands — making it especially powerful for larger tasks.\n",
